Price Prediction of Used Cars

Objective- The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of used cars based on their various attributes. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, we aim to understand the factors that influence car prices and leverage this understanding to build a predictive model.

Steps Involved
1. Data Collection
- Purpose: Gather a dataset containing information about used cars to serve as the foundation for our analysis and model training.
- Dataset Source: Used Cars Dataset.
- Attributes Included: The dataset comprises attributes such as id, url, region, price, year, manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, fuel, odometer, title_status, transmission, VIN, drive, size, type, paint_color, image_url, description, county, state, lat, long, and posting_date.

2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Purpose: Understand the dataset structure, identify and handle missing values, and prepare the data for model training.
i. Exploration:
- Methods Used: info(), describe(), and isnull().sum().
- Outcome: Gained insights into the dataset's structure, feature distributions, and presence of missing values.
ii. Preprocessing:
- Handling Missing Data: Filled missing numerical values with the mean and categorical values with the most frequent category.
- Encoding Categorical Variables: Used One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical features into numerical format.
- Scaling Numerical Features: Applied StandardScaler to standardize numerical features.

3. Feature Engineering
- Purpose: Extract and create features that can improve the model's performance by providing more relevant information.
- Extracting Features: Calculated the age of the car from the year attribute.
- Creating New Features: Developed additional features that might influence the price prediction, such as age and interaction terms between existing features.

4. Model Selection and Training
- Purpose: Choose and train an appropriate regression algorithm to predict car prices based on the processed dataset.
- Chosen Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor was selected for its robustness and ability to handle a mix of feature types.
- Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
- Model Training: Trained the Random Forest Regressor using a pipeline that integrates preprocessing steps.

5. Model Evaluation
- Purpose: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
i. Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides an error metric in the same units as the target variable.
- R-squared Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
ii. Model Predictions: Generated predictions on the test set and compared them with actual prices to evaluate performance.

6. Predict Prices Based on User Input
- Purpose: Allow users to input car attributes and receive a predicted price based on the trained model.
- User Input Function: Created a function that takes user-provided car attributes and preprocesses them similarly to the training data.
- Price Prediction: Used the trained model to predict the price based on the input attributes

7. Additional Techniques
- Feature Importance: Identified the most influential features in predicting car prices using feature importance scores from the trained model.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilized GridSearchCV to optimize the model's hyperparameters for better performance.
- Cross-Validation: Applied cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's generalizability and robustness across different data subsets.

Summary
This project involved the systematic development of a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars based on their attributes. The process included data collection, exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and training, and evaluation. By using a Random Forest Regressor and incorporating additional techniques like feature importance analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation, we aimed to create an accurate and reliable predictive model. The final model allows users to input car attributes and receive a predicted price, providing a practical tool for estimating the value of used cars.
